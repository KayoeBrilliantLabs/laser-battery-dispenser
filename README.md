## Details

This was originally designed to be cut on my Glowforge Basic laser cutter on 0.125" (1/8") wood. The SVG files were exported with an assumed kerf of 0.005" for a snug friction fit that doesn't require glue.

## Files

* battery_box.svg - Design pictured above with _DEAD_ and _CHARGED_ labels on the battery hoppers.
* battery_box_no_text.svg - Same design with no text. Some folks have reported problems opening the version with text. If you have that problem, you can use this version instead.
* battery_box_v4.f3d - Exported Autodesk Fusion 3d model for this design.
